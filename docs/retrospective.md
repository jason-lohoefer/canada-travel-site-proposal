# Project Retrospective: Canada Travel Site Proposal

## What Went Well
- The GitHub repository was set up smoothly and enabling GitHub Pages worked without major issues.  
- The scope statement gave a clear direction and made it easier to focus on a manageable topic.  
- Reusing content from an earlier project about Canada provided a strong starting point for the destinations page.  
- Keeping everything in a `docs/` folder and naming files clearly made the repo look professional and organized.  

## What Went Wrong
- Some time was lost double-checking how GitHub Pages settings worked, since it can be easy to misconfigure the branch or folder.  
- Even though the CSS was kept simple, small formatting issues took extra effort to correct.  
- At first, it was tempting to add more destinations and features, but that would have gone beyond the assignmentâ€™s scope.  

## What I Would Do Differently
- Start writing all three documents (scope, plan, retrospective) earlier in the process to avoid rushing at the end.  
- Test the live site right after the first HTML page was created instead of waiting until both were finished.  
- Make a short checklist before starting so nothing important (like the README link or proper file naming) gets overlooked.

Overall, this project tied together everything from the course: planning, documentation, and building a working prototype. It showed me that keeping things simple and organized helps the project come together with less stress and a better final result.
