# Project Scope Statement: Canada Travel Site Proposal

## Project Name
Canada Travel Site Proposal

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to propose and demonstrate a small-scale travel website that organizes simple, accessible travel information. The site will highlight destinations within Canada and share practical travel tips and resources. This project will show my ability to plan, organize, and deliver a professional project proposal package, combining project management skills and basic web development.

## Project Description
This project consists of a full proposal package stored in a GitHub repository. The package includes planning documents, a project retrospective, and a working prototype of a two-page website.

- **Home Page**: An introduction to the travel site, a navigation menu, and featured tips.  
- **Destinations Page**: Organized information about specific Canadian cities (Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Banff, Quebec City, Niagara Falls), including descriptions, planning notes, and links.  

The focus is on functionality, clarity, and structure rather than advanced design.

## Desired Results
- A live two-page travel website prototype hosted on GitHub Pages.  
- A clear, organized GitHub repository containing all planning documents and the prototype.  
- Demonstration of project management skills through a scope statement, plan, and retrospective.  
- A complete project proposal that clearly defines the purpose, deliverables, and boundaries.  

**Measurable success indicators**:  
- Website navigation functions properly.  
- Repository contains all required files (`scope.md`, `plan.md`, `retrospective.md`, `index.html`, `destinations.html`, `style.css`, `README.md`).  
- The README includes a link to the live site.  
- The live site is available at:  
  [https://jason-lohoefer.github.io/canada-travel-site-proposal/](https://jason-lohoefer.github.io/canada-travel-site-proposal/)

## Exclusions
- No JavaScript, databases, or backend functionality.  
- No attempt to expand beyond two HTML pages.  
- No advanced visual design â€” limited to basic HTML and CSS.  
- No claim that this is a fully implemented commercial website; it is a proposal with a supporting prototype.

## Priorities
1. Deliver a working prototype with functional navigation.  
2. Keep the repository professional and well-structured.  
3. Complete all planning documents according to requirements.  
4. Focus on simple, clear content presentation over visuals.
